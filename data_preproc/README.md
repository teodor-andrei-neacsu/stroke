### This repository contains a collection of data preprocessing scripts designed to streamline the process of preparing data for the task of keystroke authentication.

The 2 datasets that will be used in this work are:
- Aalto Desktop Dataset (data is publicly available at https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/136Mkeystrokes/)
- Aalto Mobile/Touch Dataset (data is publicly available at https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/typing37k/)

To use the scripts to preprocess the data, move into "./raw_data" the corresponding directories:
- "Keystrokes" folder from the Aalto Desktop Dataset
- "csv_raw_and_processed" folder from the Aalto Mobile/Touch Dataset

It also include the analysis of the users chosenm for the benchmark proposed by the TypeFormer paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13075).
